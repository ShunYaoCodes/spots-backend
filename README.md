## Spots - Backend
Spots is an app that helps people meet up at a central location. Simply enter your location and the locations of your friends and click a destination category. Spots will calculate the average point between your group and find the closest restaurant, bar or movie theater. In addition users can add new destinations to their spots database using the google places API. This Repo is a Rails backend that supports the user facing javascript web app.
